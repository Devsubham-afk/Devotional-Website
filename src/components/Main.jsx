                        In 3228 BCE in Mathura, India, a child was born who was destined to reshape the spiritual and temporal destiny of mankind—Sri Krishna. In his 125 years of life, Sri Krishna made an indelible impression upon mankind’s collective consciousness—re-educating the world about devotion and dharma as well as the ultimate reality. His life was a model for people in days past, the modern world and surely for those in ages to come. Seeing Krishna as a perfect personification of divinity, to this day hundreds of millions of people pray to him, chant his names, meditate on his form and try to put his teachings into practice. His life has inspired a treasure house of poetry, music, painting, sculpture and other fine arts. As Amma says, “His glory is unsurpassable. His story is a source of joy and inspiration for people from all walks of life.”

                    <h3>About (ISKON) Dharma</h3>

                    <div className="para">
                        International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), commonly referred to as the Hare Krishna movement, is a Gaudiya Vaishnava Hindu religious organization. It was founded by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada on July 13, 1966, in New York City. ISKCON's main headquarters is in Mayapur, West Bengal, India and it claims approximately 1 million members globally.
                        ISKCON members practice a distinct form of monotheistic Hinduism, grounded in Hindu scriptures and especially guided by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada's commentary and translation of the Bhagavad Gita and Bhagavata Purana. Described as “the largest and arguably most important branch” of the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition, ISKCON traces its roots in India to the early 16th century and expanded to gain followers in America, Europe, and Africa from the mid-to-late 20th century.
                        The Hare Krishna movement advocates for lacto-vegetarianism and was initially founded to promote bhakti yoga. Followers, known as bhaktas, dedicate their thoughts and actions to devotion toward Krishna, whom they honor as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Society_for_Krishna_Consciousness">Read more</a>
